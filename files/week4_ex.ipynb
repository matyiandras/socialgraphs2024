The group initially consisted of Craig Morris (lead vocals, piano), Billy Crittenden (baritone vocals), Lee Hilliard (tenor vocals), and Jim Chapman (bass vocals). Signed to [[Polydor Records]] Nashville, the quartet released its [[4 Runner (album)|self-titled]] debut album in 1995. It featured four charting singles on [[Hot Country Songs]], the most successful being \\\"[[Cain's Blood]]\\\" at No. 26. Billy Simon took Crittenden's place just before a second album for [[A&M Records]], which was not released despite producing a chart single, and the group broke up afterward. Morris, Chapman, and Hilliard reunited with third baritone singer Michael Lusk to release their next album, ''Getaway Car'', on the Fresh label before disbanding a second time. The group reunited a second time in 2023 with a lineup consisting of Morris, Chapman, Hilliard, and Morris's son Sam. Shortly after their reunion, Hilliard left as well, with Herbie Chapman taking his place.\\n\\n==Biography==\\n4 Runner was founded in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1993 by Jim Chapman (bass vocals), Billy Crittenden (baritone vocals), Lee Hilliard (tenor vocals), and Craig Morris (lead vocals, piano).

[[Buddy Cannon]], who produced the album with Shell, noted that he did not attempt to change the \\\"vocal blend\\\" present on the group's demo tape, and thus spent more time focusing on the musical arrangements and song selection. He also noted that the use of four-part vocal harmony made it more difficult to find suitable songs, compared to other country music groups where the vocal harmony is not as prominent.<ref name=\\\"billboard\\\"/> Polydor promoted the group via a showcase in [[Marina del Rey, California]] in which they, along with then-labelmates [[Chely Wright]] and Shane Sutton, performed before 80 radio representatives and 100 representatives of [[PolyGram]] Distribution.<ref name=\\\"billboard\\\"/> Three more singles were issued from ''4 Runner'': \\\"A Heart with 4 Wheel Drive\\\", \\\"Home Alone\\\", and \\\"Ripples\\\".<ref name=\\\"whitburn\\\"/> While none of these reached Top 40 on the U.S. country music charts, \\\"A Heart with 4 Wheel Drive\\\" made No.&nbsp;18 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts in Canada.<ref name=\\\"rpm\\\"/>\\n\\nCrittenden quit the group in October 1995 to focus more on a recording studio and publishing company which he owned at the time.

The band formed at [[San Marcos, Texas]] in the 1970s, and recorded several singles for \\\"D Records\\\" including the Strait-penned \\\"I Just Can't Go On Dying Like This\\\" and \\\"I Don't Want To Talk It Over Anymore\\\". After Strait attained status as the \\\"[[King of Country]]\\\", the group released an album of its own in 1995 featuring vocals from [[Darrell McCall]] and [[Mel Tillis]].\\n\\nThe band, originally known as \\\"Stoney Ridge\\\", performs such styles of traditional country music as [[honky-tonk]] and [[western swing]] and were influenced by such performers as [[Bob Wills]], [[Johnny Bush]], and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]].  Contemporaries of the band include [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]].\\n\\n==Background==\\n\\n===Origins===\\nThe Ace in the Hole Band derived from the band \\\"Stoney Ridge,\\\" which was composed of [[Texas State University\\u2013San Marcos|Southwest Texas State University]] (now Texas State) students Ron Cabal (lead [[guitar]]), Mike Daily ([[steel guitar]]), Terry Hale ([[Bass guitar]]), Tommy Foote ([[drum kit|drums]]) and Jay Dominguez (lead vocals). Dominguez and Foote left the band after graduating in 1975, prompting a search for a new singer. The band members posted bulletins around the campus of Southwest Texas.<ref name=\\\"texas\\\"/> One was noticed by an [[agricultural science]] student, George Strait. He contacted the band and was hired after an audition. Soon after, the group was renamed \\\"Ace in the Hole\\\" and George quickly became the lead singer.<ref name=\\\"texas\\\">{{cite web |url=http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=310&start=0&letter= |title=Ace in the Hole Band |author=Grant Mazak |date=2006 |work=Texas Music History Online |publisher=Texas State University |access-date=December 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811234143/http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=310&start=0&letter= |archive-date=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\\n\\nThe band regularly performed at Cheatham Street Warehouse in [[San Marcos, Texas]], where they debuted on October&nbsp;13,&nbsp;1975 along with new member Ted Stubblefield, who temporarily replaced Foote as the drummer. Acts such as [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] also played at the forum. The band appeared at the locale nearly every week until the early 1980s, when they began touring with Strait. Drummer Foote returned to the lineup late in 1975<ref name=\\\"texas\\\"/> and remained as drummer until 1983 when he relinquished his position to become the band's road manager.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Michael|title=San Marcos musicians discovered Strait; the rest is country music history|url=http://straitfever.homestead.com/aceintheholeband.html|access-date=2014-05-18|newspaper=Austin American-Statesman|date=2009-09-25}}</ref> Tommy Foote died in May 2024.\\n\\n===Recording===\\nIn 1976, [[Pappy Daily]], the grandfather of band member Mike Daily, decided to record the group for his \\\"D Records\\\" label at a studio in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. At the first session, the band recorded [[Dallas Frazier]]'s \\\"Honky Tonk Downstairs\\\" (later recorded on Strait's 1981 debut album ''[[Strait Country]]'') and the Strait-penned \\\"I Just Can't Go on Dying Like This\\\" (later recorded on Strait's 2013 album ''[[Love Is Everything (George Strait album)|Love Is Everything]]''). The songs were released to radio stations in Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. In 1977, Bill Mabry was added to the lineup as a fiddle player and the band recorded their second single, which featured the songs \\\"Lonesome Rodeo Cowboy\\\" (later recorded on Strait's 1990 album ''[[Livin' It Up (album)|Livin' It Up]]'') and \\\"That Don\\u2019t Change the Way I Feel About You\\\" which was written by Strait.

Known as the \\\"King of Country Music\\\", Acuff is often credited with moving the genre from its early [[string band]] and \\\"hoedown\\\" format to the singer-based format that helped make it internationally successful. In 1952, [[Hank Williams]] told Ralph Gleason, \\\"He's the biggest singer this music ever knew. You booked him and you didn't worry about crowds. For drawing power in the [[Southern United States|South]], it was Roy Acuff, then God.\\\"<ref>Escott, Colin (2004). ''Hank Williams: The Biography''. Back Bay Books. p. 22.</ref>\\n\\nAcuff began his music career in the 1930s and gained regional fame as the singer and fiddler for his group, the Smoky Mountain Boys. He joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1938, and although his popularity as a musician waned in the late 1940s, he remained one of the Opry's key figures and promoters for nearly four decades. In 1942, Acuff and [[Fred Rose (songwriter)|Fred Rose]] founded [[Acuff-Rose Music]], the first major [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based country music publishing company, which signed such artists as [[Hank Williams]], [[Roy Orbison]], and the [[Everly Brothers]]. In 1962, Acuff became the first living inductee into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name=rumble>Rumble, John (1998). \\\"Roy Acuff\\\".

By 1939, Jess Easterday had switched to bass to replace Red Jones, and Acuff had added guitarist Lonnie \\\"Pap\\\" Wilson and banjoist Rachel Veach to fill out the band's lineup.

After nearly losing his life in an automobile accident outside of [[Sparta, Tennessee]], in 1965, Acuff pondered retiring, making only token appearances on the Opry stage and similar shows,<ref name=goo /> and occasionally performing duos with long-time bandmate Bashful Brother Oswald.\\n\\nIn 1972, Acuff's career received a brief resurgence in the folk-revival movement after he appeared on the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] album, ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]''.<ref name=faber /> The appearance paved the way for one of the defining moments of Acuff's career, which came on the night of March 16, 1974, when the Opry officially moved from the [[Ryman Auditorium]] to the Grand Ole Opry House at [[Opryland USA|Opryland]]. The first show at the new venue opened with a huge projection of a late-1930s image of Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys onto a large screen above the stage. A recording from one of the band's 1939 appearances was played over the sound system, with the iconic voice of George Hay introducing the band, followed by the band's performance of \\\"Wabash Cannonball\\\".

Her father was a talented fiddle player.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utz8V5zhDYs&t=30m0s|title=YouTube|website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead YouTube link|date=February 2022}}</ref> She moved at the age of 10, along with her family, to [[Vernon, Texas]].\\n\\nIn the 1960s, Adams arrived on the country scene with the songs \\\"Six Days a Waiting,\\\" \\\"Old Heart Get Ready,\\\" \\\"Anymore,\\\" \\\"Don't Talk Trouble To Me,\\\" \\\"Trapped,\\\" \\\"Roll Out The Red Carpet,\\\" \\\"I Cried At Your Wedding,\\\" \\\"Honky Tonk Heartache\\\" and \\\"She Didn't Color Daddy.\\\" She appeared as a regular on such [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] based country music [[Television program|TV programs]] as ''[[Buck Owens' Ranch]]'' and the ''[[Dave Stogner Show]]''.\\n\\nAt the inaugural [[Academy of Country Music|Academy of Country Music Awards]], in 1965, Adams was named Top New Female Vocalist. [[Merle Haggard]] was named Top New Male Vocalist, while Top Male Vocalist and Top Female Vocalist went to [[Buck Owens]] and [[Bonnie Owens]]. The following year, Adams was nominated for Top Female Vocalist.\\n\\nBefore 1966, women never recorded songs about truck driving. Adams, however, had a hit that year with \\\"Little Pink Mack,\\\" a song giving the point of view of a woman driver, which is the only song on the album by a woman. In the song her truck has chrome and it \\\"has polka-dot curtains hangin' in the sleeper,\\\" but is the fastest big-wheeler on the road. In her \\\"truck drivin' boots\\\" she stands about five-foot three, but she can take care of herself. With a full-force [[Bakersfield sound]] twangy [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]] and some fuzz-tone [[steel guitar]] backing, she delivers the story of a truck driving woman who makes it clear she \\\"cut my baby teeth on a set of Spicer gears. I\\u2019m a gear-swappin\\u2019 mama, and I don\\u2019t know the meaning of fear.\\\" All the truckers are asked, \\\"Who's the gal in the little pink Mack?\\\"\\n\\nIt was just a couple years before [[Tammy Wynette]] sang the praises of standing by one\\u2019s man, and a decade before [[Loretta Lynn]] celebrated reproductive freedom in her controversial hit, \\\"[[The Pill (song)|The Pill]],\\\" but country singer Kay Adams demolished at least one gender stereotype in 1966 with her hit single \\\"Little Pink Mack.\\\"{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\\n\\nAdams's vocal style carried a lot of [[Wanda Jackson]]\\u2019s sassy, husky-throated [[rockabilly]] abandon, a hint of Wynette\\u2019s lovelorn sob and a sense of [[Connie Smith]]\\u2019s emotional openness.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} More than just a novelty tune, \\\"Little Pink Mack\\\" was a friendly-but-firm challenge to the testosterone and diesel-fueled world of the \\\"knights of the highway,\\\" long distance truckers.\\n\\nAdams was married first to Robert W. Willard, in 1958. They were divorced in 1967 at Bakersfield.<ref>California State Divorce Index, Kern County, Case No. 100039, State File No. 064201</ref> She and her second husband also divorced. She married for a third time, to songwriter Buck Moore. She and Willard had two sons, Daniel Ray Willard (born December 19, 1959) <ref>Texas State Birth Index, Potter County, Roll No. 1959_0017</ref> and Stewart Wayne Willard (born December 16, 1961).<ref>Kay Adams</ref>\\n\\nHer 1966 album ''A Devil Like Me Needs An Angel Like You'', was a duo with singer [[Dick Curless]]. She also sang on the [[soundtrack]]-album of the [[Western (genre)|western movie]] ''[[Killers Three]]'' (|1968), which also featured Merle Haggard and Bonnie Owens. In the 1970s, she recorded \\\"I Never Got to Nashville\\\" for [[Cliffie Stone]]'s Granite Records. Most recently she recorded \\\"Mama Was A Rock (Daddy Was A Rolling Stone)\\\" in 1996 with [[BR5-49]] for the compilation CD ''Rig Rock Deluxe: A Musical Salute To The American Truck Driver'', and \\\"Trixie's Diesel-Stop Cafe\\\" with [[The Dixie Bee-Liners]] on their 2009 bluegrass concept album ''[[Susanville]]''.\\n\\nKay Adams's albums include ''A Devil Like Me Needs An Angel Like You,'' ''Wheels And Tears,'' ''Make Mine Country,'' and ''Alcohol And Tears.''\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n=== Albums ===\\n{| class=\\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\\" style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\" border=\\\"1\\\"\\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, showing other relevant details\\n!

He has released 29 studio albums and three as a former member of [[Whiskeytown]].\\n\\nIn 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'', to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', which included the single \\\"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\\\". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]]'' (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the [[rock (album)|classic rock]]-influenced ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' (2003), after a planned album, ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', was rejected by his label [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]. As a compromise, ''Love Is Hell'' was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.\\n\\nAfter breaking his wrist during a live performance, Ryan Adams took a hiatus and formed a backing band called [[Ryan Adams & the Cardinals|The Cardinals]], who supported him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, due to complications from [[M\\u00e9ni\\u00e8re's disease]], Adams disbanded The Cardinals and took a break from music.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ryan-adams-announces-split-from-the-cardinals-hiatus-20090114 |title=Ryan Adams announces split from the cardinals, hiatus|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref> However, he returned to the music scene in 2010, releasing his 13th studio album, ''[[Ashes & Fire]]''. Adams continued his musical journey by releasing his 14th album, ''[[Ryan Adams (album)|Ryan Adams]]'' in 2014.\\n\\nIn 2015, Adams gained attention for his cover album ''[[1989 (Ryan Adams album)|1989]]'', a song-for-song cover of [[Taylor Swift|Taylor Swift's]] album of the same name. In 2019, several women accused Adams of sexual harassment, leading to a delay in the release of three planned albums. Adams later issued an apology and eventually released six  more albums between 2020 and 2022. In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Jenny Lewis]], and [[Fall Out Boy]], and has collaborated with [[Counting Crows]], [[Weezer]], [[Norah Jones]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Leona Naess]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], [[Beth Orton]] and [[Krista Polvere]].

In his own words, \\\"I started writing short stories when I was really into [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Then later, when I was a teenager, I got really hard into cult fiction: [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Jack Kerouac]].\\\" At 14, Adams began learning to play an electric guitar his mother and stepfather had bought him and soon joined a local band named Blank Label.

Whiskeytown saw Adams move to [[Alternative country|alt-country]], describing [[punk rock]] as \\\"too hard to sing\\\" in the title track of Whiskeytown's debut album ''[[Faithless Street]]''. Whiskeytown was heavily influenced by a number of country-rock pioneers, most notably [[Gram Parsons]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inman |first1=Davis |title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons |url=https://americansongwriter.com/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/?nab=1 |website=American Songwriter|date=May 18, 2012 }}</ref> The band quickly gained critical acclaim with the release of their second full-length album, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', their first [[Record label|major label]] release. A third album, ''[[Pneumonia (album)|Pneumonia]],'' was completed in 1999, but record label problems delayed its release. It was eventually released by [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]] in 2001, at which time the band was effectively done.\\n\\n===Solo career (2000\\u20132004)===\\nAdams made his solo debut in 2000, with ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' (produced by [[Ethan Johns]]).<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712133705/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=112&csid2=4&fid1=26076 'Ryan Adams Grows Up'].

It was well received. Adams, however, initially refused to promote the record through radio station meet-and-greets and other music-industry conventions, instead opting for more recording and some live dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} A video was eventually made for the album's first single, \\\"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\\\". The music video featured Adams performing in front of the city's skyline four days before the [[September 11 attacks]]. The video was played often on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] after the attacks and became Adams's breakthrough to mainstream music consumers.\\n\\nFollowing the success of ''Gold'', in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from releasing his choice for a follow-up album. This would be the second time, the first being with ''Gold;'' Adams had recorded \\\"the Suicide Handbook\\\" which was rejected on the grounds that it was \\\"too sad\\\". The label opted this time around to cherry pick (without Adams' involvement) from four of Adams' recorded albums it had already dismissed as unreleasable (48 Hours, The Suicide Handbook, The Pinkhearts and The Swedish Sessions) to create ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]],'' released in September 2002. Although the album garnered him more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as ''Gold''. The same year, Adams produced [[Jesse Malin]]'s first album, ''[[The Fine Art of Self Destruction]]'', and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group [[The Finger (band)|The Finger]] (under the pseudonyms, \\\"Warren Peace\\\" and \\\"Irving Plaza\\\" respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'', released on [[One Little Indian Records]] in 2003. He also starred in a [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] advertisement with Willie Nelson, performing a cover of Hank Williams's \\\"[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]\\\".\\n\\nIn May 2002, Adams joined Elton John on ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202201350/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 2, 2004 | title=CMT Crossroads: Elton John and Ryan Adams | access-date=April 11, 2007 | publisher = [[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> which brings together country artists with musicians from other genres. During the show, John referred to Adams as \\\"fabulous one\\\" and spoke of how ''Heartbreaker'' inspired him to record ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]'', which at the time was his most successful album in several years. Also in 2002, Adams reportedly recorded a cover of [[The Strokes]]' debut album ''[[Is This It]]'', though it has never been publicly released.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/ryan-adams/11149 | title=Adams Different Strokes in Demand! | access-date=April 11, 2007 | date=April 3, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 2002 and 2003, Adams worked on recording ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', intending to release it in 2003. [[Lost Highway Records]] deemed that it was not commercially viable and was reluctant to release it, leading Adams to go back to the studio. Two weeks later he returned to Lost Highway with ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock n Roll]]'', which featured guest musicians including [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], [[Green Day]]'s [[Billie Joe Armstrong]], and Adams's girlfriend at the time, [[Parker Posey]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=RJ |title=Ryan Adams, 'Rock N Roll' (Lost Highway) |url=https://www.spin.com/2003/11/ryan-adams-rock-n-roll-lost-highway/ |website=SPIN |date=November 11, 2003 |access-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref>  Adams' songwriting received additional exposure when [[Joan Baez]] included his song \\\"In My Time of Need\\\", from his debut release, on her 2003 album ''[[Dark Chords on a Big Guitar]].''\\n\\nAlso released in 2003, Adams formed a punk band called The Finger with [[Jesse Malin]], Colin Burns, and Johnny T. Yerington.<sup>[[The Finger (band)#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> The name derived from notorious early/mid-1990s [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] rock band Finger, of which Adams was a big fan. This light-hearted project allowed both artists to return to their punk backgrounds (Adams began his music career as singer for The Patty Duke Syndrome and Malin began his career in the hardcore punk band [[Heart Attack (band)|Heart Attack]] and more famously as the lead singer of [[D Generation]]). They began by releasing two EPs: ''We Are Fuck You'' and ''Punk's Dead Let's Fuck'' which were later collected to form the album ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'' that was released in 2003.\\n\\nAdams and Lost Highway Records eventually agreed that the label would release ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' as well as ''Love Is Hell'', on the condition that ''Love Is Hell'' be split into two EP installments. ''Rock N Roll'' and ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 1'' were released in November 2003, followed by ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 2'' in December. Both albums were well received by critics, and in May 2004 ''Love Is Hell'' was re-released as a full-length album.\\n\\n''Love Is Hell'' included a cover of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis']] \\\"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\\\", which Adams had previously performed live, and about which [[Noel Gallagher]] once said, \\\"I never got my head round this song until I went to [see] Ryan Adams play and he did an amazing cover of it.\\\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/12909 | title = The 'Wonder' of Ryan | access-date=April 11, 2007| date=October 31, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> The song earned Adams a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for \\\"[[Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance|Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]]\\\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |title=Kanye West is at top of Grammy list |access-date=August 15, 2012 |date=December 8, 2004 |publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629020925/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>\\n\\nWhile on tour to support ''Love Is Hell'' in January 2004, Adams fractured his wrist during a performance at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] in Liverpool.

Adams performed at subsequent outings of [[Phil Lesh and Friends]], including a two-night stand at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] outside of [[Denver]], Colorado and on New Year's Eve 2005 at the Bill Graham Event Center in San Francisco. Throughout 2006, Lesh's live performances included compositions by Adams, including several from ''Cold Roses'' (\\\"Cold Roses\\\", \\\"Let It Ride\\\", and \\\"Magnolia Mountain\\\").\\n\\nAdams produced [[Willie Nelson]]'s album ''[[Songbird (Willie Nelson album)|Songbird]]'', while he and The Cardinals performed as Nelson's backing band.

He joined the Depression-era [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], building roads and planting trees.\\n\\nEventually, he entered a talent contest judged by [[Asa Martin]]. He won and was invited to join Martin's band. During an early appearance, Martin forgot Akeman's name and introduced him as \\\"String Bean\\\" because of his tall, thin build. Akeman used the nickname the rest of his career.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=Virgin Books|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|pages=423/4}}</ref>\\n\\nAkeman originally was only a musician, but when another performer failed to show up one night, he was used as a singer and comic. From then, Akeman did both comedy and music. He appeared on WLAP-AM in Lexington, Kentucky and played with several groups in the late 1930s.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/>\\n\\nAkeman also played semiprofessional baseball.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Administrator |date=2020-09-09 |title=Marc Hoover: The tragic death of David 'Stringbean' Akeman |url=https://www.clermontsun.com/2020/09/09/marc-hoover-the-tragic-death-of-david-stringbean-akeman |access-date=2022-03-29 |website=The Clermont Sun |language=en-US}}</ref> As a ballplayer, he met [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] pioneer [[Bill Monroe]], who fielded with another semipro team. From 1943 to 1945, Akeman played banjo for Monroe's band, performing on recordings such as \\\"Goodbye Old Pal\\\". He also teamed with Willie Egbert Westbrook as String Beans and Cousin Wilbur, a comedy duo who appeared on the same bill as Monroe's band. When he left Monroe, he was replaced by [[Earl Scruggs]], a [[banjoist]] with a very different style.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/>\\n\\nIn 1945, Akeman married Estell Stanfill.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/> The same year, he formed a comedy duet with Willie Egbert Westbrook,<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/> and they were invited to perform on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. The following year, Akeman began working with [[Grandpa Jones]], another old-time banjo player and comedian.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/> Jones and Akeman worked together at the Opry and many years later on the ''Hee Haw'' television series.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/> They also became neighbors in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. Akeman became a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of [[Uncle Dave Macon]], one of the biggest Opry stars. Near the end of his life, Macon gave Akeman one of his prized banjos.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\\n\\n===Later years===\\nAkeman, by now known only as Stringbean, was one of the Opry's major stars in the 1950s.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/> He adopted a stage costume that accentuated his height\\u2014a shirt with an exceptionally long waist and tail, tucked into a pair of short blue jeans belted around his knees. The costume had many antecedents, including Slim Miller, a onetime stage comedian said to be Akeman's inspiration.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/>\\n\\nAkeman did not record as a solo artist until the early 1960s, when he was signed by the Starday label.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/>  Akeman remained a celebrated performer of the old-fashioned banjo playing, \\\"[[clawhammer]]\\\" or \\\"frailing\\\".  In addition to his skill as a clawhammer player, Akeman also frequently played two-finger banjo, using thumb and forefinger. Akeman is listed with Uncle Dave Macon, Grandpa Jones, and [[Ralph Stanley]] as the greatest old-time style banjo pickers.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\\n\\nAkeman kept his audience with his traditional playing and his mixture of comedy and song. He scored country-chart hits with \\\"Chewing Gum\\\" and \\\"I Wonder Where Wanda Went\\\".<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/> Between 1962 and 1971, he recorded seven albums.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The first, ''Old Time Pickin' & Grinnin' with Stringbean'' (1961), included folk songs (especially humorous animal songs), tall stories, and country jokes.\\n\\nIn 1969, Akeman and Grandpa Jones became cast members of a new television show entitled ''Hee Haw''.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/> One of his regular routines was reading a \\\"letter from home\\\" to his friends. Asked about the latest letter, Stringbean would take it out, saying he carried it \\\"right next to my heart\\\". Not finding it in his overalls pocket, he would check all of his other pockets by patting them with his hands until he found the letter, usually in his hip pocket. He was also the scarecrow in a cornfield who said one-liners before being shouted down by the crow on his shoulder. ''Hee Haw'' continued airing his taped segments following his death and his final episode was season five, episode 26, which aired on March 23, 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Q: Which \\\"Hee Haw\\\" performer was killed during a robbery at his home? {{!}} TV Tabloid |url=http://decoy.tvpassport.com/q_a/q-which-hee-haw-performer-was-killed-during-robbery-his-home |access-date=2022-03-29 |website=decoy.tvpassport.com}}</ref>\\n\\n===Murder===\\nAkeman was modest and unassuming, and he enjoyed hunting and fishing. Accustomed to the hard times of the [[Great Depression]], Akeman and his wife Estell lived frugally in a small cabin at 2308 Baker  Road, near Ridgetop, Tennessee. Their only indulgences were a Cadillac and a color TV. Depression-era bank failures caused Akeman not to trust banks with his money.<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/> Gossip around Nashville was that Akeman kept large amounts of cash on hand, though he was by no means wealthy by entertainment industry standards.\\n\\nOn Saturday night, November 10, 1973, Akeman and his wife returned home after he performed at the Grand Ole Opry. Both were shot dead shortly after their arrival. The killers had waited for hours. Their corpses were discovered the following morning by their neighbor, musician [[Grandpa Jones|Louis \\\"Grandpa\\\" Jones]].<ref name=\\\"Larkin50\\\"/>\\n\\n[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine, noting that Akeman had never learned to read or write, disclosed that he and his wife had a combined $5700 in cash on them when murdered\\u2014and that their killers had left the crime scene in Akeman's own automobile.<ref>\\\"'Stringbean' and Wife Killed in Suspected Robbery Try.\\\" Billboard, 24 November 1973, 28.</ref>\\n\\nA police investigation resulted in the convictions of cousins John A. Brown and Marvin Douglas Brown, both 23 years old. They had ransacked the cabin, and killed Akeman when he arrived. His wife shrieked when she saw her husband murdered. She begged for her life, but was shot as well. According to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, \\\"Upon their return, Mr. Akeman spotted the intruders in his home and evidently offered some resistance. One of the Brown cousins fatally shot Mr. Akeman, then pursued, shot, and killed Mrs. Akeman. At their trial (where Akeman's fellow cast member and friend Grandpa Jones testified, as he recognized one of the stolen firearms in the defendants' possession as a gift he had given Akeman), each defendant blamed the other for the homicides.\\\"<ref>''Brown v. State'', unpublished decision at 1991 WL 242928.</ref> The killers took only a chainsaw and some firearms.\\n\\nMarvin Douglas Brown fought his convictions in the appellate courts. On September 28, 1982, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the trial judge's order denying him a new trial.<ref>''State v. Brown'', 644 S.W.2d 418 (Tenn.Crim.App. 1992). On November 21, 1991, the same court denied his motion for post conviction relief. (''State v. Brown'', unpublished decision available at 1991 WL 24298)</ref> Marvin Brown ultimately granted an exclusive interview to Larry Brinton of the ''Nashville Banner''. He admitted his part in the burglary and murders, but insisted John Brown fired the fatal shots. As Marvin Brown, by his own admission, had committed burglary (a felony) that resulted in death, Brown was legally guilty of murder, regardless of who fired the shots, under Tennessee's [[felony murder rule]].\\n\\nMarvin Brown died of natural causes in 2003, at the [[Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary]] in Petros, Tennessee, and he is buried in the prison cemetery. John Brown was incarcerated in [[Lois M. DeBerry Special Needs Facility]] in Nashville. In July 2008, the Tennessee Parole Board deferred any parole for 36 months. He was again denied parole in July 2011. In 2014, John Brown was granted parole and released after serving 41 years of a 198-year sentence.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wkrn.com/story/26793495/stringbean-killer-john-brown-granted-parole |title=Man who killed Opry, 'Hee Haw' star Stringbean granted parole - WKRN News 2 |access-date=October 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018090606/http://www.wkrn.com/story/26793495/stringbean-killer-john-brown-granted-parole |archive-date=October 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2014/11/03/stringbean-akemans-killer-free-parole/18439335/|title=Stringbean Akeman's killer free on parole|website=Tennessean.com|access-date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\\n\\nThe [[A&E Network|A&E]] cable television network profiled the case on a 1999 episode of its ''[[City Confidential]]'' series.\\n\\nDavid and Estelle Akeman are buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens]] in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.

He is also the father of country singer [[Thomas Rhett]].\\n\\n==Early life==\\nThomas Rhett Akins Sr. was born on October 13, 1969, in [[Valdosta, Georgia]], to Pamela (n\\u00e9e LaHood) and Thomas Akins.<ref name=\\\"allmusic\\\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p141711/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rhett Akins biography |access-date=2008-03-09 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> By age 11, he and his two younger brothers had formed a band.<ref name=\\\"encyclocountry\\\">{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Country Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLZz02EzmBYC&pg=PA166|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-992083-9|page=7}}</ref>  Rhett played football at the [[University of Georgia]] and studied business but gave up his studies after a year. He then worked for his father\\u2019s oil and gas distribution company.\\n\\n==Career==\\n===1992\\u20131994: Move to Nashville and recording contract===\\nIn 1992,<ref name=\\\"encyclocountry\\\"/> after performing in the theme park show \\\"Music Country Music\\\" at Fiesta Texas in San Antonio, Texas, Akins moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and performed in \\\"Country Music USA\\\" at Opryland Theme Park. Akins then became a demo singer before [[Decca Records]] signed him to a recording contract.<ref name=\\\"encyclocountry\\\"/>\\n\\n===1994\\u20131997: ''A Thousand Memories'' and ''Somebody New''===\\nAkins's first single was \\\"What They're Talkin' About\\\", a No.&nbsp;35 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts in late 1994, followed by the No.&nbsp;36 \\\"I Brake for Brunettes\\\". After these first two singles came his signature song, \\\"[[That Ain't My Truck]]\\\". This was his breakthrough hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;3 on the country charts in mid-1995. All three of these songs were included on his 1995 debut album ''[[A Thousand Memories]]'', which also produced the No.&nbsp;17 \\\"She Said Yes\\\". Also in 1995 and 1996, Akins toured with [[Reba McEntire]].<ref name=\\\"allmusic\\\"/> In 1995, he was named one of ''Country America's'' \\\"Top New Stars\\\".<ref name=\\\"encyclocountry\\\"/>\\n\\nAkins' second album, ''[[Somebody New (album)|Somebody New]]'', produced his only number one hit in \\\"[[Don't Get Me Started]]\\\", which peaked in August 1996. The other three singles from ''Somebody New'' were less successful, with \\\"Love You Back\\\" (the second single) becoming his last top 40 hit at No.&nbsp;38.\\n\\n===1997\\u20132004: Transfer to MCA Nashville, ''What Livin's All About'', and ''Friday Night in Dixie''===\\nAfter Decca's Nashville division was merged into [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] in 1997, Akins was transferred to MCA Nashville for the release of his third album, 1998's ''[[What Livin's All About]]''. This album was even less successful, however, with its lead-off single \\\"More Than Everything\\\" falling one space short of top 40 in the U.S., although it was a No.&nbsp;25 hit on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' country charts in Canada. Also in 1998, Akins charted with a cover of [[Eddie Rabbitt]]'s 1980 number one hit \\\"[[Drivin' My Life Away]]\\\", which Akins covered on the soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[Black Dog (1998 film)|Black Dog]]''.\\n\\nIn 2000, he voiced the character of Tom Sawyer in MGM's animated remake of ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' alongside fellow country singer [[Mark Wills]], who voiced Huckleberry Finn, as well as [[Lee Ann Womack]], who voiced Becky's singing voice. A fourth album, ''[[Friday Night in Dixie]]'', was released in 2002 on [[Koch Records]]. This album's only two singles, \\\"Highway Sunrise\\\" and \\\"In Your Love\\\", peaked at No.&nbsp;55 and No.&nbsp;57, respectively.\\n\\n===2005\\u20132006: BNA Records and ''People Like Me''===\\nAkins did not release another single until his signing with [[BNA Records]] in 2005, when he released the No.&nbsp;57-peaking \\\"Kiss My Country Ass\\\", which was later recorded by [[Blake Shelton]] for his 2010 extended play ''[[Hillbilly Bone]]''. It was included on his album ''People Like Me'', which was originally to have been released via BNA on June 14, 2006, but was ultimately self-released in June 2007. \\\"[[If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away]]\\\" was the second single from ''People Like Me'', which failed to chart for Akins, but was later recorded by [[Justin Moore]], whose version went to number 1. ''Down South'' followed in 2008, as did its only single, the title track, which again failed to chart.\\n\\n===2009\\u20132010: ''Michael Waddell's Bone Collector: The Brotherhood Album''===\\nIn 2009, Akins released the single \\\"Hung Up\\\", which did not chart. It was later included on the 2010 album ''Michael Waddell's Bone Collector: The Brotherhood Album'', a collaboration with fellow [[country music]] singer [[Dallas Davidson]], released through [[Reprise Records]] Nashville.\\n\\n===Songwriting career===\\nIn the late 2000s, Akins began writing songs for other artists, primarily with [[Ben Hayslip]] and [[Dallas Davidson]], collaboratively known as [[The Peach Pickers]]. Among the singles that Akins has co-written are \\\"[[Put a Girl in It]]\\\" recorded by [[Brooks & Dunn]], \\\"[[Barefoot and Crazy]]\\\" by [[Jack Ingram]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.couleenews.com/articles/2009/08/14/features/01akins.txt|title=For Rhett Akins, life is good|last=Erickson|first=Randy|date=2009-08-14|work=Coulee News|access-date=2009-08-21}}</ref> \\\"[[Gimmie That Girl]]\\\" and \\\"[[The Shape I'm In (Joe Nichols song)|The Shape I'm In]]\\\" by [[Joe Nichols]], \\\"[[All About Tonight (Blake Shelton song)|All About Tonight]]\\\", \\\"[[Honey Bee (Blake Shelton song)|Honey Bee]]\\\", \\\"[[I Lived It]]\\\", and \\\"[[Boys 'Round Here]]\\\" by [[Blake Shelton]], \\\"[[When She Says Baby]]\\\", \\\"[[Just Gettin' Started]]\\\", \\\"[[Tonight Looks Good on You]]\\\" by [[Jason Aldean]], \\\"[[All Over Me (Josh Turner song)|All Over Me]]\\\" by [[Josh Turner]], \\\"Hot Mess\\\" by [[Tyler Farr]], \\\"[[Farmer's Daughter (Rodney Atkins song)|Farmer's Daughter]]\\\" and \\\"[[Take a Back Road (song)|Take a Back Road]]\\\" by [[Rodney Atkins]], \\\"[[Bait a Hook]]\\\" and \\\"[[Point at You]]\\\" by [[Justin Moore]], \\\"[[I Can Take It from There]]\\\" by [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]], \\\"[[I Know Somebody]]\\\" by [[LoCash]], \\\"[[Parking Lot Party]]\\\", \\\"[[That Don't Sound Like You]]\\\" by [[Lee Brice]], \\\"[[Hey Girl (Billy Currington song)|Hey Girl]]\\\" by [[Billy Currington]], \\\"[[I Don't Want This Night to End]]\\\", \\\"[[Huntin', Fishin' and Lovin' Every Day]]\\\" by [[Luke Bryan]], \\\"[[Wild in Your Smile]]\\\", \\\"[[Mind Reader (Dustin Lynch song)|Mind Reader]]\\\", \\\"[[Small Town Boy (song)|Small Town Boy]]\\\" by [[Dustin Lynch]], \\\"[[It Goes Like This (song)|It Goes Like This]]\\\", \\\"[[Get Me Some of That]]\\\" and \\\"[[Star of the Show]]\\\" by [[Thomas Rhett]], \\\"Granddaddy's Gun\\\" by [[Aaron Lewis (musician)|Aaron Lewis]] and \\\"[[A Buncha Girls]]\\\", \\\"[[Young & Crazy (Frankie Ballard song)|Young & Crazy]]\\\" by [[Frankie Ballard]], \\\"[[Kick It in the Sticks]]\\\", \\\"[[Small Town Throwdown]]\\\" by [[Brantley Gilbert]]., \\\"[[Ready Set Roll]]\\\" by [[Chase Rice]], \\\"[[Dirt on My Boots]]\\\" by [[Jon Pardi]], \\u201c[[To Be Loved by You (Parker McCollum song)|To Be Loved By You]]\\u201d by [[Parker McCollum]] and \\\"Missing\\\" by [[William Michael Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/files/pdfs/country_update_1121.pdf |title=Archived copy |website=www.billboard.com |access-date=15 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202222613/http://www.billboard.com/files/pdfs/country_update_1121.pdf |archive-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\\n\\n==Personal life==\\nAkins married Paige Braswell in 1989, but they have since divorced.
